* Debug problems with logx and logy not working 
    [ confirmed in spaces at least ]
    [ confirm it still actually happens ]

* KJ: I was thinking that it might be an idea to merge the mastercode-plotting
     and mastercode-tools directories. Especially, since we now use do
    ./EntryHistos.py and ./DataHistos.py for one file at the time, it makes
    sense to simply get which plots should be made from config/plot_list.py

* KJ: Another idea is to have an optional list-of-plots as specification of
    config/files.py, such that for debuggin purposes we don't need to plot a
    whole list of standard plots every time.

* KJ: Point-tools. I think we should also start working on analylis tools. I was
    thinking about the following. Immagine, we want to know more about a point
    in the m0-m12 plane. It is now very simple to find the corresponding entry
    number. Once we have the entry-number, it is easy to get the full list of
    predicions and the X^2 breakdown. We also need the 10 or 12 coordinates
    that go into the afterburner, such that we can produce slha-files:) 
    But an extention could be that once specifies however many parameters, and
    a range in which they can lie. We then search the point with the minimum
    X^2 contribution and give the same info as listed above.
