* Debug problems with logx and logy not working 
    [ confirmed in spaces at least ]

* fix variables and spaces being treated differently: too much code complexity/repition

* be dimension agnostic in histogram initialization;
    [ can do this by either:
        a) always use nbins, array_of_bins and determine this for each
        b) create a fuction to construct a list of the arguments, whcih we then splat
        i.e.
        histo = TH2[I/D]( hname, htitle, *[ *x for x in argument_constructor(TH) ] )
        it would be better to have this level of "complexity" and at least have a clear comment,
        rather than the ridiculous duplication that is going on at the moment

* update DataHistograms.py to fill teh histos for the single vars
