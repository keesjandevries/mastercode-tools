* Debug problems with logx and logy not working 
    [ confirmed in spaces at least ]
    [ confirm it still actually happens ]

* chi2 cut

* good point checks

* (agian) refactor file_dict: would be more sensible in the current state to do with a MCFile class, and MCFileCollection
    (e.g. 
        - MCFile __init__( dict ): 
            * can iterate over seq(MCFile) for plotting/histo gen
        - MCFileCollection __init__( seq_mcfile, mode ) :
            * solely for recalc: i.e. it checks branches are the same etc.
