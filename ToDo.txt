* Debug problems with logx and logy not working 
    [ confirmed in spaces at least ]
    [ confirm it still actually happens ]

* KJ: I was thinking that it might be an idea to merge the mastercode-plotting
     and mastercode-tools directories. Especially, since we now use do
    ./EntryHistos.py and ./DataHistos.py for one file at the time, it makes
    sense to simply get which plots should be made from config/plot_list.py

* KJ: Another idea is to have an optinal list-of-plots as specification of
    config/files.py, such that for debuggin purposes we don't need to plot a
    whole list of standard plots every time.



* Ok for our contribs: what we need is the variable to plot and the space.  
    We are always going to have to plot "chi2" anyway

* So for any space that we plot we wnat to know if we want to see the contributions too
