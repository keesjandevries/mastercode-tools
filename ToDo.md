ToDo

Current Development
-------------------
Need ot be able to convert to `Space` class to preserve functionality (after removing ability to do make_space)

Problems
--------
* Debug problems with logx and logy not working 
    [ confirmed in spaces at least ]
    [ confirm it still actually happens ]

CleanUp
-------
* KJ: Recalculation: should move to short names for the constraints, to unify
    the constraints for CMSSM/NUHM1, and for future use!

Functionality
-------------
* KJ: Point-tools. Print all (relevant) predictions/ X^2 breakdown; if a plane
    does not exist, make the missing plane;
